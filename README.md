# Network

MeerK40t has network support for the M2Nano. These are plain text clear TCP connections. K40ntrol uses these to send and receive commands from MeerK40t. This allows for use cases of sending a project to the k40ntrol and sending a project from K40ntrol to a device running meerk40t or directly to the laser via a USB-OTG wire.
